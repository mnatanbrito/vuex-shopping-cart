# Sample VueJS + Vuex Shopping Cart ðŸ˜‹

## What?

This is a sample VueJS + Vuex application in which a user can browse through a product catalog and add the desired items to the shopping cart.

## Why?

This is intended to serve as a way for recruiters to assess my skills when it comes to VueJS. This solution is just a rough draft of a shopping cart and **by no means** intended to be taken as a final solution. That considered, I make the following points about it:

1. I will not optimize it for real-life use;
2. I'm no great shakes as a designer (sorry about that ðŸ˜ž). So don't expect beauty. The real goal is to demonstrate how I organize and code a VueJS project as well as implement the basic flow of the application;
3. This solution does not contemplate all the possible application scenarios.

## How?

In order to run the project, just issue an

```
npm run start
```

and happy browsing (=
